| Network Mapping and Enumeration | Nmap was used to discover open ports.                                                                                              | The attackers were able to discover open ports and tailor their attacks accordingly.           |
| Wordpress Scan                  | Wpscan was utilized by attackers in order to gain username information.                                                            | The username info was used by the attackers to help gain access to the web server.             |
| Weak Passwords                  | A user had a weak password and the attackers were able to discover it by guessing.                                                 | The attackers were able to correctly guess a users password and SSH into the web server.       |
| MySQL Database Access           | The attackers were able to discover a file containing login information for the MySQL database.                                    | The attackers were able to use the login information to gain access to the MySQL database.     |
| MySQL Data Exfiltration         | By browsing through the various tables in the MySQL database the attackers were able to discover password hashes of all the users. | The attackers were able to exfiltrate the password hashes and crack them with John the Ripper. |
| Privilege Escalation            | The attackers noticed that Steven had sudo privileges for python.                                                                  | The attackers were able to utilized Stevenâ€™s python privileges in order to escalate to root.   |
